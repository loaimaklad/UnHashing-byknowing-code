# UnHashing-byknowing-code
code is only using some new hashing algorithm
itis by using ascii ord() * hashing code as you want
========================================================
"s1 = ord(x)+80*2009"
this code is using an var to save the ord of x in ascii and * with the hashing code.
in code itis using 80*2009 as a hashing code ;
=======================================================
"try :
  as1 = int(2009*80) #CODE THATIS IS USEING HASH CODE
  y=x-as1
  print(chr(y))"
this code is un-hash by using this simple-algorithm .
itis very easy .
itis using as=int(80*2009)
and y= x-as1
to get the main ord num
and print it as a char.
