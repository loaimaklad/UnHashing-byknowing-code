# UnHashing-byknowing-code
code is only using some new hashing algorithm itis by using ASCII ord() * hashing code as you want
"s1 = ord(x)+802009" This code is using a var to save the ord of x in ASCII and * with the hashing code. in code itis uses 802009 as a hashing code ;
"try : as1 = int(200980) #CODE THATIS IS USING HASH CODE y=x-as1 print(chr(y))" This code is un-hash by using this simple algorithm. itis very easy. itis using as=int(802009) and y= x-as1 to get the main ord num and print it as a char.
